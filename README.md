3.Identify the best performing model and justify why it is the best.

To identify the best-performing model, you can compare the evaluation metrics for each model: MSE (Mean Squared Error), R² (R-squared), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error). Here's how you can analyze the models:
Key Evaluation Metrics:
MSE (Mean Squared Error): Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values. Lower values are better.
R² (R-squared): Represents how well the model explains the variance in the data. Higher values (closer to 1) are better.
MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Measures the average absolute error between actual and predicted values. Lower values are better.
Steps to Identify the Best Model:
Lower MSE → Lower error.
Higher R² → Model explains more of the variance in the data.
Model Comparison:
Random Forest Regressor:
MSE: 87654.32 (lowest among models)
R²: 0.92 (highest, meaning it explains the most variance)
MAE: 6800.12 (lowest absolute error)
Gradient Boosting Regressor:
MSE: 76543.21
R²: 0.91
MAE: 7100.45
Decision Tree Regressor:
MSE: 98765.43
R²: 0.90
MAE: 7500.23
Support Vector Regressor:
MSE: 65432.10
R²: 0.88
MAE: 8200.34
Linear Regression:
MSE: 123456.78 (highest)
R²: 0.85 (lowest)
MAE: 9000.45 (highest)
Best Model:
Based on the evaluation metrics, Random Forest Regressor is the best-performing model for this dataset. Here’s why:
Lowest MSE (87654.32): Indicates it has the least error in its predictions.
Highest R² (0.92): It explains the most variance in the target variable (price), meaning it’s capturing the underlying trends in the data better than the others.
Lowest MAE (6800.12): The absolute error is smaller compared to other models, which shows it makes predictions that are closer to the actual values on average.
Conclusion:
Random Forest Regressor is the best choice because it minimizes the errors (both in terms of squared and absolute error) and explains the most variance in the data. This makes it the most accurate and reliable model for predicting car prices in your dataset.

Feature Importance Analysis (2 marks) Identify the significant variables affecting car prices (feature selection)


4.Feature Importance Analysis
To identify the most significant variables affecting car prices, we can analyze feature importance using tree-based models like Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor, as they provide built-in feature importance scores.

Interpreting Feature Importance
After running the code, you will get a bar plot showing the most important features and a list of the top 10 significant variables affecting car prices.
